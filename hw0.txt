# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
I think that this exercise was a little easier with a bit of a coding background.
However, it has been a while since I wrote code so it took a bit to organize my thoughts
and make sure that there were no loopholes in my instructions.

I think one part that is a little unsatisfying with writing this out in english is that
I can't test my code with the computer to see if it works.

As for the class, I am hoping to add another language to my toolkit, and hopefully will be
able to use this skill in industry.
